# Brest-Cancer-Prediction-by-Machine-Learning

The Jupyter Notebook Breast_Cancer_Prediction.ipynb presents a machine learning project for predicting breast cancer using datasets such as the Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer dataset. It involves data preprocessing, feature scaling, and training classification models like Logistic Regression, K Neighbourhood Classifier, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine. The notebook evaluates the models using metrics such as accuracy score, aiming to distinguish between benign and malignant cases effectively.
